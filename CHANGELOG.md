# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 3.3 - 2018-03-19
### Added
 - Parameter `-EXIFtoolFailSafe` - pre-run Exiftool. Exiftool tends to fail when being run for the first time with commands ([see Note b with installing the standalone executable](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/install.html)), so now it will have time to get cracking.


## 3.2 - 2018-03-17
 - **Up to this version, I did not keep track of particular changes.**

### Changed
 - The whole code in a manner so that it now will withstand a unit-test.
